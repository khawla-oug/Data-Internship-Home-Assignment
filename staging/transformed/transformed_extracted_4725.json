worldltbrgtltbrgtMiso Robotics is writing an epic new story for the restaurant industry Weve developed a robotic kitchen assistant Flippy that can perform a variety of kitchen tasks including flipping burgers and running the deep fryer Our product is a robotic arm on a rail that fits into existing kitchens along existing cook lines and is designed to work with existing equipment alongside kitchen workers Under the hood Flippy relies on our platform which combines deep learning and other computer vision technologies with optimizationbased scheduling and nonlinear control to adapt quickly to a variety of kitchen workflows while achieving graceful and efficient motionltbrgtltbrgtThe challenge of bringing robotics into commercial kitchens requires many disciplines to come together The compositions of teams at Miso Robotics reflect this multidisciplinary nature of our work We have built a worldclass team and we are looking for more exceptional people to join us If you believe like we do that the future of the kitchen involves robotics and artificial intelligence HINT It definitely does and if you want to count yourself among the handful of lucky people whove found themselves
