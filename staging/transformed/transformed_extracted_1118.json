innovative aerospace systems with advanced data science Unlike traditional aerospace companies we sell information not hardware  we operate our sensors costeffectively at continental scale to produce novel data streams about pressing global problemsltpgtltpgtampnbspltpgtltpgtFirst on our listampnbspspotting hardtomonitor emissions of methane a potent greenhouse gas that accelerates climate change Since starting continuous survey operations in  Kairos has removed methane emissions equal to over  million tonnes of COe through our work To put that in perspective thatus equivalent to over  million
