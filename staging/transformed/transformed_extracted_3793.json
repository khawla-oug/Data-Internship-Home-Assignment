advancing programs in the promisingbutstillunproven field of messenger RNA mRNA to an enterprise with its first medicine having treated millions of people a diverse clinical portfolio of vaccines and therapeutics across six modalities a broad intellectual property portfolio in areas including mRNA and lipid nanoparticle formulation and an integrated manufacturing plant that allows for both clinical and commercial production at scale and at unprecedented speed Moderna maintains alliances with a broad range of domestic and overseas government and commercial collaborators which has allowed for the pursuit of both groundbreaking science and rapid scaling of manufacturing Most recently Modernaus capabilities have come together to allow the authorized use of one of the earliest and mosteffective vaccines against the COVID pandemicltbrgtltbrgtModernaus mRNA platform builds on continuous advances in basic and applied mRNA science delivery technology and manufacturing and has allowed the development of therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases immunooncology rare diseases cardiovascular diseases and autoimmune diseases Today  development programs are underway across these therapeutic areas with  programs having entered the clinic Moderna has been named a top biopharmaceutical employer by Science for the past six years To learn more visit wwwmodernatxcom
