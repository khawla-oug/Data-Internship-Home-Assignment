  "CleanedDescription": "context httpschemaorg type JobPosting datePosted TZ description Data is deeply embedded in the product and engineering culture at Tesla We rely on data u lots of it u to improve autopilot to optimize hardware designs to proactively detect faults and to optimize load on the electrical grid We collect data from each of our cars superchargers and energy products and use it to make these products better and our customers saferltbrgtltbrgtWere the Fleet Analytics team a small but fastgrowing central team that helps many teams leverage the data we collect We help engineers through direct support by doing data analysis for them and through applications and tools so they can selfserve those analyses in the future To do so we leverage the internal big data platform that is built on top of Kafka Spark Presto and data science tools such as Jupyter notebooks Pandas Bokeh Superset and AirflowltbrgtltbrgtWere looking for an experienced engineer to join us This foundational member will provide leadership in the definition and implementation of processes and tools that enable Teslas data scienceltbrgtltbrgtYou will lead our Prognostics application where we build machine learning pipelines to help identify which cars may need service so we can address issues before they inconvenience our customers Building this application is crucial to improve our customer experience as well as to optimize service operations and logistics You will own the application endtoend from prioritizing which issues to focus on to building the features and predictive models to bringing those models to production and writing the code that acts on your predictions You will directly further our mission by reducing the cost associated with cars breaking down and
