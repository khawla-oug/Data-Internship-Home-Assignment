recruiting a Postdoctoral Scholar to develop improved tools for the detection of biotic stress diseases and weeds in annual crops in the Southwestern US The Scholar will support the USDANIFAfunded project ucArtificial Intelligence for Sustainable Water Nutrient Salinity And Pest Management in The Western USud httpsaisaucredu The overall goal of this project is to develop advanced tools for early stress abiotic and biotic detection and decision support for crop management The Scholar will work with agricultural scientists extension personnel and growers and other industry clientele to collect imagery via unmanned aerial systems UAS and satellites and georeferenced data on pest outbreaks via field surveys The Scholar will use these data in collaboration with computer scientists to develop machine learning algorithms for the detection and management of biotic stress The crops and pest systems to be included in this project are flexible but are expected to be relevant to agriculture in Arizona and CalifornialtpgtltpgtampnbspltpgtltpgtltstronggtResponsibilitiesltstronggtltpgtltulgtltligtManage small plot field experiments on the detection of diseases or weeds with
